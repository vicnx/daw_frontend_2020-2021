Exercice "dancing_hello_world".
- Parameters such as the increment and the object to be moved are passed to the Start function.
- I have exported and imported the stopball, start and docReady functions so that I can use them. In the html when importing the script it is set to type module
- To the Stopball function we also pass the variable where the interval is stored as a parameter.
- by default it is working with webpack
- If you want to test that it works without webpack go to the html and uncomment the line that imports the main.js and comment the line imported by the main generated by the webpack. Then run the webpack server and it will work
